--- START GENERATION SEQUENCE ---

[IMAGE 1: Page 1 Script - The Mystery]
Layout: Vertical stack, 4 panels.
Panel 1: Remi and Yuto stand in a dojo where the floor is a static wave pattern. Title: 「レミと優斗の量子力学」
Panel 2: Yuto points at a cat that is both skeletal and fluffy at once.
Panel 3: Remi looks through a viewing glass. Her own face reflected is screaming.
Panel 4: The dojo walls begin to dissolve into equations.

[IMAGE 2: Page 2 Script - Superposition]
Layout: Vertical stack, 4 panels.
Panel 1: Thugs appear, but their bodies are blurred "probability clouds".
Panel 2: A thug strikes Yuto, but the sword passes through him like a ghost.
Panel 3: Remi draws her blade. In one panel, she is slashing; in the same panel, her sword is still sheathed.
Panel 4: Thugs flicker in and out of existence.

[IMAGE 3: Page 3 Script - Observation]
Layout: Vertical stack, 4 panels.
Panel 1: Remi closes her eyes. Everything around them vanishes into void.
Panel 2: Yuto screams: 「姉さん、目を開けて！見てないと消えちゃう！」
Panel 3: Remi opens her eyes. The dojo snaps back, but twisted and organic.
Panel 4: A giant eye opens in the ceiling, observing them.

[IMAGE 4: Page 4 Script - Climax]
Layout: Vertical stack, 4 panels.
Panel 1: Thugs merge into a single, massive wave-form monster.
Panel 2: [IMPORTANT: Remi's hair MUST be Silver #E0E0E0]. Remi strikes. Her slash is a "wave function collapse".
Panel 3: Deep shadows, but Remi's face is illuminated by a cold light.
Panel 4: The monster explodes into infinite particles.

[IMAGE 5: Page 5 Script - Resolution?]
Layout: Vertical stack, 4 panels.
Panel 1: Silence. They are back in the real dojo.
Panel 2: Yuto looks relieved, adjusting his Gakuran.
Panel 3: Remi smiles, but her shadow on the wall has multiple arms.
Panel 4: They walk away. The dojo door behind them is both open and closed.
