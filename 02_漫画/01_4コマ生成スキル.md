# Create 4-Koma Manga Skill

This skill allows you to generate a 4-koma manga (vertical 4-panel comic) from a simple theme provided by the user.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user asks to generate a manga, 4-koma, or comic strips, especially if they specify a "theme" or "story idea".

## How to use

1. **Analyze the Theme**: Understand the user's provided theme or concept.
2. **Draft the Content**: Create a brief story structure with:
    * **Title**: A catchy title.
    * **Characters**: Brief definition of characters (appearance).
    * **Panels 1-4**: Scenario and dialogue for each panel.
        * Panel 1: Intro (Ki)
        * Panel 2: Development (Sho)
        * Panel 3: Twist (Ten)
        * Panel 4: Conclusion (Ketsu) - The punchline.
3. **Construct the Prompt**: Use the mandatory "Vertical Layout Template" below. Fill in the specific scenes and dialogue.
4. **Generate Image**: Use the `generate_image` tool with the constructed prompt. Name the image relevant to the content (e.g., `4koma_theme_name`).

## PROMPT TEMPLATE (Mandatory)

You MUST use the following structure for the image generation prompt to ensure the 4-panel layout works correctly. Replace the bracketed placeholders `[...]` with the generated content.

```

## Tips for Success

* **Characters**: Keep character descriptions consistent across all panels (e.g., "Silver haired woman in red blazer").
* **Dialogue**: Keep Japanese dialogue short and punchy for better rendering.
* **Model**: The user prefers `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` (nanobanana pro). If `generate_image` supports model selection, specify it. If not, the prompt structure itself is optimized for high-quality models.
